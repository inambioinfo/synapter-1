	year = {2003},
	volume = {100},
	pages = {9440-9445},
	number = {16},
	abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of
	multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace
	in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a
	genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where
	a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose
	an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide
	studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach
	offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives
	that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing
	so, a measure of statistical significance called the value is associated
	with each tested feature. The value is similar to the well known
	value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false
	discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach
	avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal
	criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage. },
